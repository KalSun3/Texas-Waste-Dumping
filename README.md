# Texas Chemical Waste Dumping

	> The goal of our project was to highlight facilities and the areas where there are chemicals being released in the environment within Texas and pinpoint so far what year has the most, as well as what areas have the most.

## Dashboard Instructions

	> To use our dashboard you can click through the tabs which shows you the map thought process with our project, you can also view the presentation to understand more on where we pinpointed. You will want to push the back button to return to the home screen to then click on a new tab. 
* Tab 1 is time lapse heat map waste releases from 2008 to 2023. 
* Tab 2 is a interactive map that shows waste release intensity. There are color coded icons to display low, medium or high waste release intensity in lbs. You can zoom in and hover over an icon and a bubble will display the county, the year, the amount of waste released in lbs. 
* Tab 3 displays the overall waste release intensity from 2008 to 2003. 
* Tab 4 is a bubble map showing the release of carcinogens and noncarcinogens. Carcinogens are known to increase the risk of cancer.

## Ethical Considerations
	> According to the Environmental Protection Agency website, the purpose of the Toxics Release Inventory program is to track facilities progress in reducing waste and moving toward safer waste management. The TRI reports are based on self-reported data from facilities, but there have been cases of noncompliance. Usually the biggest consequence these facilities face are fines. Our visualizations show an increase in the release in toxic chemicals, which could be due to the rising number of reporting facilities over time. Other than not wanting to pay for fines for noncompliance and meeting the minimal amounts of waste that can be legally released, there are few incentives for facilities to reduce their waste. These incentives include accolades and monetary benefits, such as grants and tax credits. The main incentive should be wanting to minimize the acute and chronic conditions caused by releasing these chemicals, as well as the adverse effects that some of these chemicals have on our environment.
